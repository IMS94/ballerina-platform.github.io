## Configuring Secure Communication

This is done by providing the optional `secureSocket` property in the [HTTP Listener Configuration](/learn/api-docs/ballerina/#/ballerina/http/latest/http/records/ListenerConfiguration) instance when creating the [`http:Listener`](/learn/api-docs/ballerina/#/ballerina/http/latest/http/listeners/Listener).

## Example of HTTPS Endpoint configured Public Certificate and Private Key

The example below shows how an HTTPS service is configured with public certificate and private key.

```ballerina
import ballerina/http;
 
http:ListenerConfiguration conf = {
   secureSocket: {
       key: {
           certFile: "/path/to/public.crt"
           keyFile: "/path/to/private.key",
       }
   }
};
 
service / on new http:Listener(8443, conf) {
    resource function get greeting() returns string {
        return "Hello!";
    }
}
```

## Example of HTTPS Endpoint configured KeyStore

The example below shows how an HTTPS service is configured with KeyStore.

```ballerina
import ballerina/http;
 
http:ListenerConfiguration conf = {
   secureSocket: {
       key: {
           path: "/path/to/keystore.p12"
           password: "password",
       }
   }
};
 
service / on new http:Listener(8443, conf) {
    resource function get greeting() returns string {
        return "Hello!";
    }
}
```
