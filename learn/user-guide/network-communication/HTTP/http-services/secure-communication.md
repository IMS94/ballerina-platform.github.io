## Configuring Secure Communication

This is done by providing an optional [`ListenerConfiguration`](/learn/api-docs/ballerina/#/ballerina/http/1.0.6/http/records/ListenerConfiguration) instance when creating the [`http:Listener`](/learn/api-docs/ballerina/#/ballerina/http/1.0.6/http/listeners/Listener) client and providing the secure socket configurations. 

## Example

The example below shows how an HTTPS service is configured. 

```ballerina
import ballerina/http;
import ballerina/os;
 
http:ListenerConfiguration listenerConf = {
   secureSocket: {
       keyStore: {
           path: os:getEnv("BAL_HOME") +
                 "/bre/security/ballerinaKeystore.p12",
           password: "ballerina"
       }
   }
};
 
service / on new http:Listener(8443, listenerConf) {
    resource function get greeting() returns string {
        return "Hello!";
    }
}
```

## Execution

The execution of the service and its invocation is shown below.

```bash
$ export BAL_HOME=`bal home`

$ bal run demo.bal

[ballerina/http] started HTTP/WS listener 0.0.0.0:8080

$ curl -k https://localhost:8443/greeting
Hello!
```
